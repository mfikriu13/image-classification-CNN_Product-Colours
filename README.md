# image-classification-CNN_Product-Colours
This project aims to build an image classification model that can recognize product colors based on a dataset from Digikala, one of the largest e-commerce platforms in Asia. The model utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture to predict product colors from input images.
